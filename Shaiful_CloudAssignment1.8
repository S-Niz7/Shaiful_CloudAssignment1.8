Assignment 1.8
Q1: Give the advantages and disadvantages of magnetic storage devices

Advantages
•	The speed to process data and information is very fast therefore these magnetic disk 
•	The data stores in these devices are stored almost permanent (non-volatile / data loss due to power loss.
•	Cheaper and lighter in weight.
•	Magnetic disks support direct access to data and therefore they are more suitable for a wide range application.
•	Magnetic disk possesses random access properties, therefore, they are used in shared project and applications where multiple users can use a project 
  simultaneously.
•	Magnetic disks are suitable for both offline and online storage of data. Zip drives and floppy disks are used in offline secondary storage devices.
•	High-end Winchester disks are used in personal computers where users enjoy the use of software and applications.
•	Capacity to store a huge amount of data 
•	Their cost is very low and the density to store the volume of data is huge as well as one can store and delete data easily.
•	They are very light in weight and can store huge data in less space.
•	Due to their light in weight and compact size they can be easily transferred from one location to another. They are also used in copying data from one 
  computer to another.
•	These magnetic disks are not vulnerable to temperature and humidity, therefore, the chances of data damage and corrupt is way less as compared to another 
  alternative.
•	The storage capacity is unlimited as many numbers of disk required can be added

Disadvantages
•	They must be stored in a dust-free environment
•	The data /information can be erased unintentionally due to easy access.
•	Magnetic disks are costlier than magnetic tapes
•	Winchester disk a type of magnetic disk is not as portable as magnetic tapes.
•	The security features on magnetic disks cannot be easily maintained as they are on the distributed and shared networks.
•	A disk drive or disk failure results in loss of entire data stored on it.

Q2. What are some use cases for RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5 and RAID 10 that you have found?

RAID 0
Usage: Used in applications that require high performance and can tolerate lower reliability. Suited only where data isn’t mission critical, such as video/audio post-production, multimedia imaging, gaming, data logging or where it’s acceptable to lose a complete drive because the data can be quickly re-copied from the source

RAID 1
Usage: Generally, only used in cases where there is not a large capacity requirement, but the user wants to make sure the data is 100% recoverable in the case of a drive failure, such as accounting systems, video editing, gaming etc. Small servers, high-end workstations, and other environments with no large capacity requirements, but where the user wants to make sure the data is 100% recoverable in the case of a drive failure.

RAID 5
Usage: Often used in fileservers, general storage servers, backup servers, streaming data, and other environments that call for good performance but best value for the money. Cost-effective solution if continuous data access is a priority and/or you require installing an operating system on the array.

RAID 10
Usage: Ideal for high volumes of data, fast read and write times, and high fault tolerance. Operation uptime and availability are critical for intense workflows, example hospital or government database
